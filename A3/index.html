<!-- For this project, my focus was on creating a digital tool where users can roll dice for various 
    games and purposes. The intended audience for this product is broad and includes game players,
     educators, online gaming communities, and casual users. The webpage features a click-and-drag 
     action to roll the dice; upon release, the dice rolls before returning to its original position.

     The design emphasises realism and intuitive user interaction to enhance the overall experience. 
     By incorporating shaking and rolling mechanics like a physical dice, users can click and drag the 
     digital dice just as they would naturally handle them in real-world scenarios. This adds a sense 
     of authenticity and empowers users with a tangible sense of control and freedom. The click-and-drag 
     functionality enables direct manipulation of the dice on screen, fostering a tactile engagement
      that heightens immersion. When users interact with the dice, they experience a more engaging 
      and lifelike interaction, making the digital dice roller both functional and enjoyable.

<!-- Cross-platform compatibility could be an issue, ensuring that the project works seamlessly across 
    different browsers and devices. As well as different input methods such as mouse or touch screen devices. 

  Since the project relies solely on the user clicking and dragging accessibility could be an issue.
  In order to make this accessible for everyone it would require some iterations to the UI. Possibly 
  implementing keyboard navigation support and compatibility with screen readers would improve the 
  project's usability.
