    <p class="question">

    <!-- seperating my body of text by using classes. "question" will be used for any questions, "answer" will be used for answers and "answer2" is for answers in list format. I did this because I wanted the padding to be slightly different for the list format.-->
    <p class="answer">
      When first engaging with the webpage, my attention was captured by the
      vibrant comic book-style layout. The bright colours and playful animations
      instantly made it feel like I was entering into the pages of a story. This
      design choice not only made the webpage visually appealing but also gave
      it a unique personality that made me want to explore further.
    </p>

    <p class="question">
      Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of your
      discrete actions.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li class="answer2">
        ‘Resume’ and ‘Linked in’ button change to a lighter yellow when hovering
        over them
      </li>
      <li class="answer2">
        As I scroll and hover over different sections, textboxes with headings
        and body text pop-up. These disappear when the mouse leaves that section
      </li>
      <li class="answer2">
        The arrow icon in the top left corner of the textboxes moves when you
        hover over it
      </li>
      <li class="answer2">
        Textboxes slightly change to lighter grey when directly hovering over
        them
      </li>
      <li class="answer2">

        you scroll

        hovering directly over
      </li>
    </ul>
    <!-- using a list structure because it will improve the readability and overall layout flow -->
    <p class="question">
      What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with?
    </p>
    <p class="answer">
      I spent the most time engaging with the comic book-style panels in the
      main body of the webpage. I was drawn to them because of their colourful
      design and animations. What interested me the most was how the imagery
      provided a glimpse into the content before even interacting with it. This
      feature made the browsing experience more engaging and interactive. I
      found myself spending extra time hovering over each panel, and comparing
      it to the imagery underneath .
    </p>
    <p class="question">
      What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with the
      experience?
    </p>
    <p class="answer">
      The most common action was definitely the textboxes popping up. Some of
      the other actions like the hover effect on the buttons are a lot more
      discrete since the hover area that triggers the action is smaller. The
      textboxes popping up as you scroll is the most common since the area of
      the panels is quite large.
    </p>
    <p class="question">
      What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive
      experience?
    </p>
    <p class="answer">
      Considering this webpage is a designer's portfolio, the primary goal is to
      showcase the designer's UX design skills. The interactive elements, such
      as the comic book-style layout, engaging animations and navigation, serve
      as a demonstration of the designer's creativity and ability to create an
      immersive user experience
    </p>
    <p class="question">
      How does the interactive experience communicate this primary goal?
    </p>
    <ul>

        encourage users to further explore the website.

    <p class="question">
      What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with
      over time?
    </p>
    <p class="answer">
      This page is designed to be easily interacted with in a small amount of
      time (2-5 minutes). This is logical given it is a portfolio and potential
      employers or clients might not spend a lot of time reading lengthy
      webpages. By offering sufficient context and prominent links to important
      content, users can quickly access the most relevant information without
      the need for extensive browsing or visiting multiple times.

      Users are drawn in by the engaging design and concise presentation of
      information, making it easy to quickly grasp the essence of the portfolio.
      As users explore further, they encounter interactive elements and details
      that invite them to delve further into specific projects or sections. The
      seamless navigation guides users through the portfolio, making it easy to
      access content and information during the first visit.
    </p>
    <p class="question">
      What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience
      reference?
    </p>
    <p class="answer">
      The strongest reference within this experience is its reference to comic
      books. Bold animations, text and visual layout are utilised to enhance the
      visual storytelling. Being the primary visual style, it adds a playful and
      engaging element to the webpage.
    </p>
    <p class="question">
      What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should act
      when engaging with your research experience?
    </p>
    <p class="answer">
      The reference to comic books communicates that when engaging with the
      experience, I should act with a sense of exploration, interaction, and
      attentiveness. I should actively pay attention to detail and explore
      different sections. Additionally, I should pay close attention to the
      storytelling elements present in the portfolio, piecing together
      information and themes.
    </p>
    <p class="question">
      What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should feel
      when engaging with your research experience?
    </p>
    <p class="answer">
      I should approach the experience with a sense of curiosity, ready to
      explore their creation. The interactive elements and storytelling aspects
      of comic books suggest that I should be actively engaged and open to
      uncovering hidden details and narratives within the pages. Overall, the
      reference to comic books encourages me to feel excited and enthusiastic
      about exploring their interactive experience.
    </p>
    <p class="question">
      What is the most frustrating part of the interaction to you and what makes
      that part frustrating?
    </p>
    <p class="answer">
      I haven't encountered any significant frustrations while interacting with
      the webpage. This lack of frustration seems to stem from the thoughtful
      consideration the creator put into the user experience. Their attention to
      detail likely ensured smooth navigation and easy access to information,
      minimising potential points of frustration for users. The only minor
      challenge I encountered was with the heading that changes based on scroll
      direction. Initially, I didn't notice this feature immediately, and when I
      did, I found it slightly difficult to interact with smoothly, especially
      when using a trackpad.
    </p>
    <p class="question">
      What is the most satisfying part of the interaction to you and what makes
      that part satisfying?
    </p>
    <p class="answer">
      The most satisfying part of the interaction for me is the seamless
      navigation and the visually captivating design of the webpage. The
      intuitive layout and smooth transitions between sections make it
      effortless to explore the content, while the vibrant colours and dynamic
      animations add a sense of excitement and engagement.
