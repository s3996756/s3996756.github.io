      <h3>What genre of creative software do you believe it belongs to?</h3>
      <p>
        Orb Farm belongs to the simulation software genre, more specifically the
        xxx genre.
      </p>

      <h3>List three other examples of software in this genre</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>1</li>
        <li>2</li>
        <li>3</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>
        List the program's interactive features/mechanics (one sentence max
        explanation per feature/mechanic)
      </h3>
      <ul>
        <li>COâ‚‚ metre - changes based on in-game elements</li>
        <li>reset button - clears the environment, resetting the simulation</li>
        <li>fast forward/ speed up button - alters the simulation speed</li>
        <li>clear - allows user to erase specific elements</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Placeable Elements:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          adds glass - pen mechanic hold and drag cursor to place anywhere
          within orb
        </li>
        <li>sand - click/drag to place/ will fall to the bottom of the orb</li>
        <li>stone click/drag to place/ will fall to the bottom of the orb</li>
        <li>
          wood - pen mechanic hold and drag cursor to place anywhere within orb
        </li>
        <li>
          water- click/drag to place/ will flow to the bottom of the orb but
          will spread out with more fluidity than other elements
        </li>
        <li>
          algea - click/drag to place/ will fall to the bottom if not water but
          floats on water/ able to place directly in water
        </li>
        <li>
          daphnia - click/drag to place/ will fall to the bottom of the orb,
          grow overtime
        </li>
        <li>
          grass - click/drag to place/ will fall to the bottom of the orb, will
          grow overtime
        </li>
        <li>
          bacteria - click/drag to place/ will fall to the bottom of the orb
        </li>
        <li>
          fish - can be placed directly in water they will swim around/ will
          fall to bottom & die if no water is present
        </li>
        <li>
          goldfish - can be placed directly in water they will swim around/ will
          fall to bottom & die if no water is present
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>
        What did you find annoying and/or boring about interacting with it?
      </h3>
      <p>
        at times i felt like the moving background was a bit too distracting, it
        would of been nice if i was able to pause the movement of the
        background. i would of liked to be able to have the information about
        the different elements open to the side while interacting with the game
      </p>

      <h3>What did you find enjoyable about interacting with it?</h3>
      <p>
        overall the experience was quite enjoyable, i liked how the orb
        developed overtime by itself. i liked being able to have the tab open in
        the background and check back in every once in awhile to see how it was
        developing
