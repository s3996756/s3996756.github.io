      <h2>research questions</h2>

      <h3>What genre of creative software do you believe it belongs to?</h3>
      <p>Orb Farm belongs to the simulation software genre, more specifically the Virtual Sandbox genre.</p>

      <h3>List three other examples of software in this genre</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>1</li>
        <li>2</li>
        <li>3</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>
        List the program's interactive features/mechanics (one sentence max
        explanation per feature/mechanic)
      </h3>
      <ul>
        <li>COâ‚‚ metre - changes based on in-game elements</li>
        <li>reset button - clears the environment, resetting the simulation</li>
        <li>fast forward/ speed up button - alters the simulation speed</li>
        <li>clear - allows user to erase specific elements</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Placeable Elements:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>glass</li>
        <li>sand</li>
        <li>stone</li>
        <li>wood</li>
        <li>water</li>
        <li>algea</li>
        <li>daphnia</li>
        <li>grass</li>
        <li>bacteria</li>
        <li>fish</li>
        <li>goldfish</li>
      </ul>

        What features/mechanics indicate its genre by aligning with its
        conventions?

      <h3>
        What features/mechanics common to its genre are missing or might be
        added?
      </h3>

      <h3>
        What context, community or niche is it primarily aimed at and what
        indicates this?
      </h3>

      <h3>
        What did you find annoying and/or boring about interacting with it?
      </h3>
      <p>at times i felt like the moving background was a bit too distracting, it would of been nice if i was able to pause the movement of the background. i would of liked to be able to have the information about the different elements open to the side while interacting with the game  </p>

      <h3>What did you find enjoyable about interacting with it?</h3>
      <p>overall the experience was quite enjoyable, i liked how the orb developed overtime by itself. i liked being able to have the tab open in the background and check back in every once in awhile to see how it was developing</p>
