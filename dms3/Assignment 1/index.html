      <h3>What genre of creative software do you believe it belongs to?</h3>

      <h3>
        What features/mechanics indicate its genre by aligning with its
        conventions?
      </h3>
      <p>
        The game features reactive physics-based elements and provides players
        with a high level of freedom to build and manipulate the world. The
        world behaves dynamically, changing based on how the user's action. With
        no explicitly set end, or objectives, it encourages exploration and
        replayability.
      </p>

      <h3>What features/mechanics are novel for its genre?</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          orb shaped environment: Orb Farm is contained within a circular
          container, creating a compact, enclosed biome. This design makes it
          feel more confined and intimate compared to traditional sandbox games
          like Minecraft or Sandboxels, which offer larger, rectangular, and
          more expansive environments.
        </li>
        <li>
          ecological balance: Although there is no explicit goal for users, Orb
          Farm describes itself as creating a 'self-contained food chain',
          meaning the game emphasises using elements to build a self-sustaining
          ecosystem that operates without requiring constant user intervention.
          This is unique for its genre because most sandbox simulation games
          rely on user intervention to create/maintain balance.
        </li>
        <li>
          water-based: Orb Farm is unique in its specific focus on aquatic
          ecosystems. Unlike other sandbox-style simulations that have a broad
          focus on elements like fire, water, and ground, Orb Farm focuses on
          the dynamics of closed water ecosystems and explores how aquatic
          elements rely on and influence one another. This focus creates a more
          specialised and unique experience.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>
        What features/mechanics common to its genre are missing or might be
        added?
      </h3>
      <p>
        Orb Farm currently lacks any sound, including both UI feedback for
        actions like button clicks or element dragging, as well as ambient
        sounds from the environment itself.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even the addition of basic sound feedback when interacting with the
        elements, such as gentle water sounds when adjusting the ecosystem or
        subtle auditory cues when adding or removing components, would create a
        more dynamic and engaging experience, without disrupting the game's
        relaxing nature. Including ambient sounds, such as the calming flow of
        water or soft bubbling noises, could further align with the game's focus
        on environmental simulation.
      </p>

      <h3>
        What context, community or niche is it primarily aimed at and what
        indicates this?
      </h3>
      <p>
        Orb Farm primarily aimed at a community of players who enjoy relaxing,
        low-pressure simulation games with a focus on environmental simulation
      </p>
      <p>
        This is indicated by the relaxed gameplay, which lacks time constraints
        or explicit goals, making it appealing to players who prefer slow,
        stress-free gameplay with a focus on experimentation over competition.
        This is further highlighted by the simple, minimalist design of the
        mechanics and UI. The game's emphasis on creating a self-contained
        ecosystem will appeal to those with an interest in nature,
        sustainability, and ecology, particularly those who enjoy designing
        environments without combat mechanics.
      </p>

      <h3>
        What did you find annoying and/or boring about interacting with it?
      </h3>
      <p>
        At times, I found the moving background a bit too distracting. It would
        have been nice to have the option to pause the background movement. I
        also would have preferred the ability to keep the information about the
        different elements (info button) visible on the side while interacting
        with the game.
      </p>

      <h3>What did you find enjoyable about interacting with it?</h3>
      <p>
        Overall, the experience was quite enjoyable. I liked how the orb
        developed over time on its own. It was nice being able to have the tab
        open in the background and check back every once in a while to see how
        it was progressing.
