      <!-- one of the interaction features i decided to add to my project was an 
ambient sound bar. this choice was make because when I play lo-fi or study music
I think the ambient noise is often a nice feature that can help convey a feeling
of relaxation and create a peaceful environment. 

one thing i had to consider about this was giving the control to the user,
i considered that people would have preferences around ambient sound and allowing
the user to be able to customise this was an important part of the addition of this 
feature. I added a increase & decrease volume- In a perfect scenario
I would of liked to be able to add even more customisable settings but this i think is
a basic enough control given my coding skills

      <!-- another feature i decided to add to my project was a pomodoro timer. 
      These are quite popular and useful for studying. most peoples experience would be
    having to open a timer in a second tab or using their phone, so i decided that
  intergating this into my project was improve user experience and imrpove the usefulness of 
my product -->

      <!--  I decided to add a 'currently playing' and 'up next' box
I think this feature is something that is quite nice to have when 
your using the media player as something your playing in the background and enhances
the user experience.

I decided to style all of my content into their own containers with headings.
I think this makes for better visual hierarchy, and makes it easier to see what your
looking at at a glance-->
